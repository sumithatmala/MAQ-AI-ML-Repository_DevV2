      <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
      <p>
        Create a comprehensive and user-friendly web portal that serves as a
        centralized hub for all our AI/ML competencies. This initiative aims to
        address existing challenges in our current implementation on SharePoint
        and elevate our representation to align with industry standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Product Details: Provide detailed information about our AI/ML
          products, including specifications, use cases, and technical details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced Demos: Showcase product features and capabilities through
          updated demo videos, moving away from code-centric presentations to
          more user-focused content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactive Tool: Host a dummy version of our tools on the website,
          allowing users to explore its functionalities directly and gain a
          hands-on experience. (Similar to Power BI portal)
        </li>
        <li>
          Intuitive UI Design: Ensure that the website's user interface is
          intuitive and user-friendly, catering specifically to business users.

      </ul>

      <p>
        The current SharePoint implementation faces challenges such as outdated
        content, code-centric demos, and older user interface. This proposal
        aims to rectify these issues, ensuring that our AI/ML competencies are
        presented in a manner that is not only up to date but also resonates
        with our target audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        By doing so, we aim to match and exceed the industry standards set by
        our competitors which helps us in accelerating presales activities.
      </p>

      <h3>Inclusion of OpenAI Use Cases</h3>
      <p>
        Additionally, the proposed website will feature a dedicated section
        highlighting our competencies and achievements in OpenAI use cases.
        Given the growing demand for OpenAI technologies, this section will not
        only serve as a testament to our capabilities but also attract
        prospective clients interested in these cutting-edge solutions.
